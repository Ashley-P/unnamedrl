----- DEBUG MODE THOUGHTS -----
Opens a file at game start that it logs everything from start to finish
Has a command line along with various debug messages (which means I have to implement a parser)

Something like this and goes at the top of the screen

+------------------------------------+
|                                    |
|                                    |

Should be called from any menu?

--- Commands ideas --- 
- Spawn actor/object
- Delete actor/object
- Get ID/address of actor/object under cursor
- Change vision modes (Visual of Djikstra maps or something)
- Raw editing of actors/objects?
- Move actors/objects/player
- Toggle FOV
- Echo (more of a test command)

--- Other ideas for the command line ---
- Autocomplete commands (never gonna do this)
- Clipboard
- Command history
- Scrolling the history


--- Command structure ---
>COMMAND ARGUMENTS...
The first word in each line is the command and the rest of the words/numbers are arguments
The word is checked on against a list and returns a message if it's not on there.
If it is on the list, then the corresponding function is ran with it's arguments.
Inside the function there is some error checking against the arguments. Might be able to emulate
function overloading too with different kinds of arguments. (Should be easy considering you would know
that if a function is called, you know what arguments it should be taking)
